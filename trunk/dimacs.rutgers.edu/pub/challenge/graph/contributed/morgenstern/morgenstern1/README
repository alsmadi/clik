mpggen : "Algorithmica" planar graph generator, modified to produce
	 maps in dimacs challenge format.

ggen : A graph generator to construct some known types of graphs, including
       random graphs, K-partite graphs, Leighton graphs, and geometric
       graphs.  Graphs are dumped to a specified file in dimacs format.

Leighton_in : Input files to build Leighton graphs using ggen.
