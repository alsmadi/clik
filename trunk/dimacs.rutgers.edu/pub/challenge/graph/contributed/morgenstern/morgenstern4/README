This is the code used to produce the 4-coloring data given in

    C. Morgenstern and H. Shapiro. 1991.
    Heuristics for Rapidly Four-Coloring Large Planar Graphs.
    Algorithmica, 6, 869-891.

Sample maps files are given in Rgo/MAPS/R002.Z and Ego/MAPS/E002.Z; the
remaining maps described in the paper can be obtained from anon ftp in
pub/morgenstern/maps on red.cs.tcu.edu (138.237.7.8).  The entire map set
requires 35 Megs compressed.  Each map file contains 10 maps, and the res 
executable does a batch run and gathers statistics on all the maps in a file. 

The res executable expects three command line arguments:

res <map_file_name> <heuristic_selection_file> <output_file>

The heuristic selection files used are in Rgo and Ego.
