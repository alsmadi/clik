What's all this?

code/  contains Preston Briggs's code to pull out register allocation
       graphs from iloc files.  Read the README file in code/ to
       get more information on his work.  You must compile this
       code before you can construct any graphs.

datafiles/  contains many iloc files, courtesy of Preston Briggs.

bin/  contains Make_register_graphs.  This is a shell script which
      takes a list of iloc file names (just the names, not the path,
      unless you change the file) and outputs the interference
      graphs that result from running Briggs's igraph program on
      the files.  These files are constructed in DIMACS challenge
      format.

testfiles/  results of Make_register_graphs are stored here.  The
	    files with .dat suffixes are the DIMACS format graphs.
	    The .i files are the output of Brigg's program.
	    I've got some examples in there right now so you can
	    see what the output looks like. 

What you need to do
-------------------
1)  Compile Briggs's code by doing a make in the code/ directory.
2)  Modify the paths listed in the Make_register_graphs file
      to reflect your own directories (currently it's set to mine,
      and that certainly won't help you :-)).
3)  That's it.  (I hope!)

NOTE
----
The resulting graphs usually have some vertices that are completely
independent of all others, so the number of vertices listed is
generally less than the number of vertices with outdegree larger
than 0.

I may write some more scripts to process the .dat files into
'reduced' form -- graphs containing only nodes with outdegree larger
than one.
