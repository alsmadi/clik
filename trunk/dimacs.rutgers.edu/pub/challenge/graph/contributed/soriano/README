instances.

From the code:

(*  Random graph generator that generates graph instances according to	   *)
(*  the P_HAT generation scheme as described in:			   *)
(*    Gendreau, M., P. Soriano and L. Salvail, "Solving the maximum clique *)
(*    problem using a tabu search approach", Annals of Operations Research *)
(*    41, 385-403							   *)
(*									   *)
(*  Author: Patrick Soriano						   *)
(*  Date: 29-07-1993							   *)
(*									   *)
(*  Input parameters:						           *)
(*      n -> the size (number of vertices) of the graphs generated;        *)
(*      a, b -> the two density parameters characterizing the type of      *)
(*		graph being generated, where a and b stisfy		   *)
(*		   0  <=  a  <=  b  <= 1  ;				   *)
(*	nb_prob -> the number of problem instances being generated (note   *)
(*		   that all instances generated in the same run will have  *)
(*		   identical characteristics and will be stored in a       *)
(*		   single file that will have to be split afterwards ---   *)
(*		    BEWARE of the resulting file SIZE when nb_prob > 1 );  *)
(*      f_prob -> name of the output file containing the graphs.	   *)
(*									   *)
(*  Output:								   *)
(*	the generated graph instances are copied on the output file	   *)
(*	"f_prob" in the DIMACS Challenge format, i.e. approx. 1 line per   *)
(*	edge, so BEWARE of output file sizes !!!			   *)
