These are the new files and generator for flat graphs.
In addition to presenting the graphs under a random permutation of the
vertices, the graphs are tested using the simple greedy algorithm under the 
permutation to see if the expected coloring is obtained.

The sample graphs contained here should be isomorphic to the old ones,
but with a random permutation of the vertex labels.
