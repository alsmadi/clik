graph/doc/ccreview.tex: A review of past work on finding cliques
	and coloring graphs.  This is a work in progress that will be
	updated as more information becomes available.  This paper
	also has more than a dozen suggested research projects.
	Please write to challenge@dimacs.rutgers.edu if you have
	additional references or suggested research topics.

graph/doc/ccreview.dvi, graph/doc/review.ps: dvi and
	postscript versions of above document.

graph/doc/ccreview.bib:  A BibTeX file of the references in the
	above.

graph/doc/ccannote.tex:  A TeX file that prints out all of the
	references along with a one or two line annotation on most of
	them.  Requires BibTeX (a program normally bundled with TeX
	and LaTeX) and annotate.bst (below).

graph/doc/annotate.bst: A BibTeX style file required for ccannote.tex.

graph/doc/ccformat.tex:  Suggested graph format consistent with
	the format used in the First Computational Challenge on
	networks and matchings.  A fairly verbose but flexible format
	suitable for a variety of graph and network algorithms.  Not
	yet the "official" format, but likely to become so unless
	strong objections are made.
